### A Comprehensive Survey of Deep Learning for Image Captioning :
-   https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3295748
-	Source: Google Schoolar
-	Search term: Image Captioning
-	Description: Image captioning requires recognizing the important objects, their attributes, and their relationships in an image. It also needs to generate syntactically and semantically correct sentences. Deep-learning-based techniques are capable of handling the complexities and challenges of image captioning.

### Image Captioning: Transforming Objects into Words: 
-   https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/680390c55bbd9ce416d1d69a9ab4760d-Paper.pdf
-	Source:Google Schoolar
-	Search term: Image Captioning
-	Description: Image captioning models typically follow an encoder-decoder architecture which uses abstract image feature vectors as input to the encoder. One of the most successful algorithms uses feature vectors extracted from the region proposals obtained from an object detector (Object Relation Transformer).

### Areas of Attention for Image Captioning: 
- https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Pedersoli_Areas_of_Attention_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf 
-	Source: Google Scoolar
-	Search Term: Areas of attention for image captioning
-	Description: Comparing different ways of generating attention areas: CNN activation grids, object proposals, and spatial transformers nets.

### Image Captioning With Semantic Attention:
- https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/You_Image_Captioning_With_CVPR_2016_paper.html
- Source:Google Schoolar
- Search Term: image captioning neural network
- Description: A new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks. The selection and fusion form a feedback connecting the top-down and bottom-up computation

### Semi Supervised Learning for Image Captioning
- https://paperswithcode.com/paper/perturb-predict-paraphrase-semi-supervised
- PapersWithCode: Semi Supervised Learning
- Shows how a paraphrase generator could be effectively used for label augmentation to improve the quality of pseudo labels and significantly improve performance

### Vision-based vehicle detection and counting system using deep learning in highway scenes: 
-   https://etrr.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12544-019-0390-4.pdf 
-	Source: Google 
-	Search term: Vehicle detection 
-	Description: The object size of the vehicle changes greatly at this viewing angle, and the detection accuracy of a small object far away from the road is low. In the face of complex camera scenes, it is essential to effectively solve the above problems and apply them.
